    <h1>Luwum</h1>
    <p>We were new to Namasagali college, and as had yet to get our house fully organised. Father Grimes had invited us to dinner in his house. After I stayed for a game of chess.</p>

<p>While we were playing a young man arrived. He looked nervous, or even scared. Father Grimes introduced us; “Luwum”, he said “He was head boy. His father is Anglican Archbishop of Uganda. “Not any more” said Luwum. “He’s dead - I’m going to Kenya - Can I stay here tonight?”. “All right, go to the kitchen and see if John can give you something to eat. Come back and sit here until I finish this chess game.”</p>

<p>Father Grimes was delighted to win the chess game. “What happened?” he asked Luwum. “They had a car crash on the road to Jinja”. “They?”. “Three of them: - he was with Mr Oryema and someone else. They were supposed to be going to Entebbe”.</p>

<p>Father Grimes grimaced. “How did you find out?”. “They sent some men to tell us”. “Police or Security?”. “Maybe police; They took us to see the body”. “Did you see him?”. “He was covered with a blanket. We saw his face but they wouldn’t let us see any more”. They are taking his body back to Gulu. We aren’t going to the funeral.</p>

<p>There is something seriously wrong if any Ugandan does not go to his fathers funeral.</p>

<p>“Have you seen Oryema?”. I was later to learn Vincent Oryema was a 6th former and school prefect whose father was a Ugandan Cabinet Minister. “No, I haven’t spoken to anyone but you”. “I’ll speak Vincent after study. I’ll tell him to keep it to himself until we get confirmation the body is identified”.</p>

<p>Luwum left for Kenya before dawn.</p>

<p><em>I have just looked up Arcbishop Luwum on Wikipedia. This account varies in some respects, but what I have written is what I remember.</em></p>

<p><em>I have today learned Archbishop Luwum’s statue is now on Westminster Abbey among the 20th Century Martyrs.</em></p>
