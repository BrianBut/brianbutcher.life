I"ž<p>My first cycle touring holiday started at Weston Super Mare railway station. I remember the sulphurous smell and the hiss of the engine of as the guards van was opened to reveal my fathers black â€˜Herculesâ€™  bike and my small red â€˜Raleighâ€™. We were to pedal distance of sixteen to twenty miles between youth hostels. I think we spent the first night at Crowcombe Youth Hostel. I was eight years old.</p>
