I"~<p>This is a Paleartic migrant present in Debre Birhan from August to April.</p>

<p>These photos were taken in very bright light, when it was difficult to perceive colours. It may be that the colours in the fifth picture are more accurate. This is a yellow legged species, smaller and with a more active jizz than the following species. It appears ‘hunched’ when it moves.</p>
