I"3<p>There is little about the eye of the <b>Red-Eyed Dove</b> in this picture to justify the name. 
The dull red eye ring is virtually invisible.
The diagnostic broad buffy band at the tip of the tail is clearly visible.</p>

<p>The dove in the background is a <b>Dusky (Pink-Breasted) Turtle Dove</b>.</p>
