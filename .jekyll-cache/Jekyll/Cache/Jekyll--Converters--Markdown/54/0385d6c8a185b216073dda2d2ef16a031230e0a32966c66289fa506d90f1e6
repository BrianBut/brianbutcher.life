I"?<p>We rather liked Hissing Sid. He was a snake; a four foot long olive brown snake about as fat as a garden hose. Not a cobra as he there was no widening around his throat. Not an adder as he didn’t have a ‘V’ shaped head. He was some sort of a grass snake; I forget which, but I believed him to be harmless.</p>
