I"Y<p>Frequently seen at the top of the waterfall (September-Feb). There are often half a dozen birds spaced along a 100 yard stretch of rocky river at the top of the falls. They largely keep to the rocks in the river and the rocky grassy islands. When disturbed they fly to another spot a few yards along the river. I have never seen one run.</p>
