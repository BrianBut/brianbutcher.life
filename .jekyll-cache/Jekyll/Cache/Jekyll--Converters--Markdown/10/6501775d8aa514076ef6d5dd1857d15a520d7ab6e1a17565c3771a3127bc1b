I"0<p>Botsalano game reserve lies alongside the road between Mafeking and Gabarone, very close to the border between South Africa and Botswana. 
It has a delightful campsite quite close to the gate, from where you can walk a little through the sandy dry savannah grass. The meerkats enjoy watching you.</p>
