I"Ç<p>We were new to Namasagali college, and as had yet to get our house fully organised. Father Grimes had invited us to dinner in his house. After I stayed for a game of chess.</p>

<p>While we were playing a young man arrived. He looked nervous, or even scared. Father Grimes introduced us; â€œLuwumâ€, he said â€œHe was head boy. His father is Anglican Archbishop of Uganda. â€œNot any moreâ€ said Luwum. â€œHeâ€™s dead - Iâ€™m going to Kenya - Can I stay here tonight?â€. â€œAll right, go to the kitchen and see if John can give you something to eat. Come back and sit here until I finish this chess game.â€</p>

<p>Father Grimes was delighted to win the chess game. â€œWhat happened?â€ he asked Luwum. â€œThey had a car crash on the road to Jinjaâ€. â€œThey?â€. â€œThree of them: - he was with Mr Oryema and someone else. They were supposed to be going to Entebbeâ€.</p>

<p>Father Grimes grimaced. â€œHow did you find out?â€. â€œThey sent some men to tell usâ€. â€œPolice or Security?â€. â€œMaybe police; They took us to see the bodyâ€. â€œDid you see him?â€. â€œHe was covered with a blanket. We saw his face but they wouldnâ€™t let us see any moreâ€. They are taking his body back to Gulu. We arenâ€™t going to the funeral.</p>

<p>There is something seriously wrong if any Ugandan does not go to his fathers funeral.</p>

<p>â€œHave you seen Oryema?â€. I was later to learn Vincent Oryema was a 6th former and school prefect whose father was a Ugandan Cabinet Minister. â€œNo, I havenâ€™t spoken to anyone but youâ€. â€œIâ€™ll speak Vincent after study. Iâ€™ll tell him to keep it to himself until we get confirmation the body is identifiedâ€.</p>

<p>Luwum left for Kenya before dawn.</p>

<p><em>I have just looked up Arcbishop Luwum on Wikipedia. This account varies in some respects, but what I have written is what I remember.</em></p>

<p><em>I have today learned Archbishop Luwumâ€™s statue is now on Westminster Abbey among the 20th Century Martyrs.</em></p>
