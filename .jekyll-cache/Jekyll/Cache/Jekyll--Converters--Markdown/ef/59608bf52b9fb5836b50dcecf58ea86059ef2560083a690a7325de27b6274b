I"ƒ<p>I remember places. In this place we had stopped for a pee break in the heat of the early afternoon sun. We had not seen a human being in the last hour as we had driven across Murchison Park, and it was unlikely we would see a single person in the next hour and a half before we were out of it. In the dry grass of this stopping place  the only animals we might see were warthogs.</p>
