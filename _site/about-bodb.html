    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>These photos were all taken while I was in Debre Birhan from 2008-2010. I was trying to help with computing in the Teacher Training College and to a lesser extent the university. In that respect I failed miserably.</p>

<p>There is a huge variety of birds to be seen, many of them endemic to Ethiopian highlands. Wikipedia places the town at 2840 metres (9320ft). The university is up a small hill from the town and the lake upstream from that. The two seasonal streams drop into a deep gorge which eventually becomes the Nile gorge, 5000 feet deep. The inaccesibility of the cliffs makes this a secure place for some birds.</p>

<p>The Amharic people of Ethiopia are largely Coptic Christians. They never eat poultry regarding it as unclean to eat. They never molest or hunt birds for sport. The outcome is that resident species, such as the Blue-Winged Goose are very approachable, unlike migrants such as Pintail or Shoveller Ducks.</p>

<p>I am not an expert bird watcher, but it would be unusual for me to go out for a walk and not come back with a photo of a species I had never seen before.</p>

<p>All pictures were taken with a hand held camera. Sunlight in Debre Birhan with intense UV because of the altitude. In these conditions I was never able the set the camera exposure correctly.</p>
