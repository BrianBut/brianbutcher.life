    <h1>Tilapia and Matoke</h1>
    <p>This was my most memorable meal.</p>

<p>Simon and I had risked our lives on taxi from Kampala to Masaka.  (Not musaka, for that was what I ate with chips on some other memorable meals in another time and another place). Those taxis, Peugot 404 estates, were always overcrowded and driven dangerously fast.</p>

<p>In Masaka we found another taxi which was driven much more sensibly to somewhere well to the south. I forget the name, but it was a Roman Catholic Mission. Simon knew the Monsigneur, a monsigneur Sematiki, or something like that. The only thing I can remember is that it was a name beginning with ‘S’, but not a common Ganda name.</p>

<p>This was the first Roman Catholic mission I ever visited; the first of many. Most purpose built Catholic missions are build on the layout of a Roman villa, with a covered path around the edge of the atrium. We were each assigned a room on the perimeter of the atrium and then fed. Simon contributed some tinned food, but we were provided with a wonderful meal. Even now I remember the colour and flavour of that fibrous yellow matoke that had been steamed in a banana leaf. And the baked tilapia, and the groundnut sauce.</p>

<p>I didn’t even struggle with the bones of that fish. I have no idea how they did it. I just ate it.</p>
