    <h1>The Bishops Throne</h1>
    <p>The third term of teacher training at Makerere was a posting in a school. Along with four other young men I was posted to Kako Senior Secondary School in the Teso district of Uganda. The five of us were accomodated in the house originally built by and for Bishop Kitching.  It had seven bedrooms and a large communal dining rooms. With a high ceilings and a wide veranda all round the house it was wonderfully cool.</p>

<p>Bishop Kitchenâ€™s house was approached by a long avenue, more than 100 metres in length with mature mango trees along either side. There was no toilet inside the house. The throne room was a large hut in the middle of a patch of grass visible, but not too close to, the veranda.</p>

<p>So we had five male students, with student appetites and student cooking skills.</p>

<p>We had unlimited ripe mangos.</p>

<p>We had yet to develop any resistance to the myriad stomach bugs and other ailments of tropical Africa.</p>

<p>We had this wonderful throne room.</p>

<p>The throne was situated absolutely central in throne room. I remember it being absolutely central in this large room, as big as any living room in modern day Britain.</p>
