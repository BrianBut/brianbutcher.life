    <h1>Gabriel</h1>
    <p>Although I have worked on Christian Missions for about ten years I am not a Christian. In fact I feel more sympathy with paganism than I do Christianity, but I cannot believe in any form of God.</p>

<p>Gabriel is a Christian and one of the nicest people I have ever met. A lecturer in Divinity and chaplain to the University, he had inherited both job and the house which had once belonged to Desmond Tutu. I got to know Gabriel when his computer got infected by a virus. To my shame I was unable to recover the book he had written. Gabriel was a firm believer in the ‘Truth and Reconciliation’ commitee, and ‘Truth and Reconcilliation as a method for solving human conflict. But although well meaning he is hopelessly impractical and without the first notion of anything scientific.</p>

<p>Gabriel had seen Philip Morrison in his wheel chair coming into the University. He asked me who he was. I explained as that Dr Morrison was an eminent physicist who had discovered a way that people on other planets might communicate, and was part of an organisation looking for intelligent beings on other planets. He had previously been a leader of the project to make the first atomic bomb.</p>

<p>Of course Gabriel had no inhibitions about approaching a person with a disability. Wearing his dog collar went up to Phil introduced himself and asked about Phil’s inability to walk. Phil replied with one word; “Polio”. Philip Morrison does not like being helped because he cannot walk.</p>

<p>After Phil’s second talk, about SETI (Search for extraterrestrial intelligence). People were invited to discuss. There was very little discussion except that from Gabriel.</p>

<p>Gabriel took the view that if inhabitants of other stars discussed things, they would be bound to get on. He clearly envisaged a sort of inter-stellar ‘Truth and Reconcilliation Council’. Phil pointed ot that it was likely that it would take at least 20 years for a message from our nearest possibly inhabited neighboring planet to reach the earth.</p>

<p>Ex Communist Party member Phil was nonplussed by Gabriels suggestion he should pray for a faster method of sending messages by radio.</p>

<p>Communication between intelligent beings is as likely to succed as communication between some good well-intentioned humans.</p>
