    <h1>Mousaka and Chips</h1>
    <p>The University of Surrey was once Battersea College of Advanced Technology, located in Battersea Park Road. The first shop to the the left of the College facing the road, was a record shop. Alf’s cafe was a few doors along. I and some of my friends preferred to have lunch here.</p>

<p>The mousaka and chips was the chief lure, with a cup of tea. With this for lunch you were comfortably set up for the day. A plate full of freshly cooked chips with mousaka spreading all across the top. It makes my mouth water to this day.</p>

<p>When complemented on the quality of the food he would claim, with a grin that ‘the vegetables ‘fell off the back of a lorry’.</p>
